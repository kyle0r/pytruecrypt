2025-July - Notes from Kyle

Back in January 2008, Bj√∂rn published his research on TrueCrypt containers on his blog in a post entitled ‚ÄúTrueCrypt Explained‚Äù. Archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20241205141842/http://blog.bjrn.se/2008/01/truecrypt-explained.html). Bj√∂rn's research provides lots of insights into TrueCrypt and cryptology, as well as a complete and functional code sample.

I saved an offline copy of the content in the `misc/web-archive` folder as a backup.

üëç It was great that Bj√∂rn provided enough libraries for his code to run standalone, and even in 2025, the code still runs with Python 2.7 without any issues.

In 2025, while researching TrueCrypt's LRW mode, I came across Bj√∂rn's research. As my objective was to decrypt some old LRW mode containers, I decided to update Bj√∂rn's work to Python 3 to satisfy my curiosity and deepen my understanding. To document the original work and illustrate the changes I made, I included the original `src/*` files in the first commit of this repository.

I've hosted an [intro video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/VzStk_Rd6Bk), as its larger than the max supported attached file size.

# INSTALL

To run the Python 3 code, try the following:
```
repo_url=https://github.com/kyle0r/pytruecrypt.git
# cd into the cloned repo dir
git clone "$repo_url" && cd $(basename "$repo_url" .git)

# setup python venv
python3 -m venv venv

# activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install/upgrade dependencies
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --use-pep517 -r requirements.txt

# Note: The following read command is bash specific - not POSIX compliant or portable.
# If you aren't using bash, paste the one-liner into a GenAI prompt and ask for a version for your preferred shell.
# store password in $REPLY var without echoing input
read -srp "enter password - no echo mode on: "; echo

# test the password against a test container
python3 ./src/truecrypt.py ./tests/data/test-rijndael-sha1.tc "$REPLY" output.log
```
üí° The test TrueCrypt containers all use the password: `password`

## JIT?
What about speeding things up with a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler? The original Python 2 code utilised the `psyco` JIT package if it was available. I have included the following PyPy3 example as a replacement and comparison to the  `psyco` package. To run the Python 3 code with PyPy3 try the following:
```
# install pypy3 packages
sudo aptitude install pypy3 pypy3-dev

# as above clone the repo

# create the pyyp3 venv
pypy3 -m venv venv

# continue as above
```
üí° In my quick testing, I found that PyPy3 was slower than standard CPython for individual executions of `src/truecrypt.py` against a TrueCrypt container with an incorrect password.  
It is possible that PyPy3 could speed up the `truecrypt.TCReadSector` decryption loop, but I did not test this performance aspect, as my primary focus was on the TrueCrypt header.

---
# Tests
If you'd like to run the tests, then:
```
# from the repo root dir

# activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pytest

pytest
```

---
# Historic Python 2 code

To run the historic Python 2 code: `git checkout pre-python3` tag from the repository and try the following:

```
# Note: The following read command is bash specific - not POSIX compliant or portable.
# If you aren't using bash, paste the one-liner into a GenAI prompt and ask for a version for your preferred shell.
# store password in $REPLY var without echoing input
read -srp "enter password - no echo mode on: "; echo

# test the password against a test container
# uses python -B to skip python byte code cache generation
python2.7 -B ./src/truecrypt.py ./tests/data/test-rijndael-sha1.tc "$REPLY" output.log
```

## TODO
- Document `src/truecrypt.py` capabilities and features (incl. omissions/gaps).
- Expand `src/truecrypt.py` test cases.
  - Consider asserting the output file of `truecrypt.TCReadSector` contains a known byte sequence.
  - Add test cases to cover exception/unhappy paths including not able to seek when testing hidden containers
- Use the python `argparse` package for the cli interface.
- Use obtained knowledge and code to extend the `hashcat` project to support TrueCrypt LRW mode.  
  This would provide GPU accelerated cracking of the older LRW mode to compliment the existing XTS mode.
- Create a simple Makefile to make installing, running tests, and other repetitive tasks easier.
  - Debian related: `apt -s install --no-install-recommends make`
  - Potential targets: install, test (covers linting), clean (remove venv and other cruft).
  - Clean target notes:
```
find . -depth -a \( -path './venv*' -o -path '*\.pytest_cache*' -o -path '*__pycache__*' \) -a -print -a -delete |less
```
