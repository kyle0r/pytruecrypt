2025-July - Notes from Kyle

Back in January 2008, Bj√∂rn published his research on TrueCrypt containers on his blog in a post entitled ‚ÄúTrueCrypt Explained‚Äù. Archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20241205141842/http://blog.bjrn.se/2008/01/truecrypt-explained.html). Bj√∂rn's research provides lots of insights into TrueCrypt and cryptology, as well as a complete and functional code sample.

I saved an offline copy of the content in the `misc/web-archive` folder as a backup.

üëç It was great that Bj√∂rn provided enough libraries for his code to run standalone, and even in 2025, the code still runs with Python 2.7 without any issues.

In 2025, while researching TrueCrypt's LRW mode, I came across Bj√∂rn's research. As my objective was to decrypt some old LRW mode containers, I decided to update Bj√∂rn's work to Python 3 to satisfy my curiosity and deepen my understanding. To document the original work and illustrate the changes I made, I included the original `src/*` files in the first commit of this repository.

## TODO
- Document `src/truecrypt.py` capabilities and features (incl. omissions/gaps).
- Use python `argparse` package for the cli interface
- Use the knowledge and code to update the `hashcat` project to support TrueCrypt LRW mode.  
  This would provide GPU accelerated cracking of the older LRW mode to compliment the existing XTS mode.

# Historic Python 2 code

To run the historic Python 2 code: `git checkout pre-python3` tag from the repository and try the following:

```
# Note: The following read command is bash specific - not POSIX compliant or portable.
# If you aren't using bash, paste the one-liner into a GenAI prompt and ask for a version for your preferred shell.
# store password in $REPLY var without echoing input
read -srp "enter password - no echo mode on: "; echo

# test the password against a test container
# uses python -B to skip python byte code cache generation
python2.7 -B ./src/truecrypt.py ./tests/data/test-rijndael-sha1.tc "$REPLY" output.log
```
